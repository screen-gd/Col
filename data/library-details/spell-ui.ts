  agentPrompt: `Add Spell UI (https://spell.sh) to this existing project.

Spell UI is a curated collection of animated React components for landing pages and marketing sites, built on shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS and motion. The catalog at https://spell.sh/docs/components currently lists 33 components (buttons, text animations, marquees, cards, backgrounds such as light-rays and animated-gradient, and inputs). Nothing is installed from npm as a package: each component is copied into this repo as source by the shadcn CLI from the registry https://spell.sh/r/{name}.json.

Prerequisites:
- React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS, with a components.json in the project root. Run npx shadcn@latest init first if it is missing.
- Registry docs: https://spell.sh/docs/introduction, https://spell.sh/docs/components, https://spell.sh/docs/mcp. A plain-text version of any docs page is available by appending .md, for example https://spell.sh/docs/mcp.md, and each component page has a Manual tab with the full source.

Steps:
1. Read the docs at https://spell.sh/docs/introduction and pick components from https://spell.sh/docs/components. Do not guess component slugs; read them off the component pages.
2. Register the registry in components.json by adding to the existing object: "registries": { "@spell": "https://spell.sh/r/{name}.json" }. Keep the other keys already in that file.
3. Add the first component from the project root with the command from its docs page, for example npx shadcn@latest add @spell/perspective-book. Let the CLI install the component's dependencies, which are listed in the registry item.
4. First usage: import it exactly as the component page's Usage section shows, for example import { PerspectiveBook } from "@/components/perspective-book";, render it in an existing page, and confirm the app still builds. Keep the component local and edit it freely.
5. Repeat for the remaining components. If I want to drive the catalog from an editor instead, run npx shadcn@latest mcp init (per https://spell.sh/docs/mcp) and then ask the agent for a component by name.

Optional: the source of the site itself is public at https://github.com/xxtomm/spell-ui (MIT), which is useful for checking how a component behaves or for reporting a fix upstream.

Use only component names, props and install commands documented on spell.sh.`,

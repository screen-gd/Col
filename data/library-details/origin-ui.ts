Prerequisites: React with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS v4 already set up (Next.js works out of the box). Components are installed as source files through the shadcn CLI, so they live in this repo and get edited directly instead of being imported from npm.

Steps:
1. Read the official docs first and follow them rather than guessing: https://coss.com/ui/docs and the get started page https://coss.com/ui/docs/get-started.
2. Check for a components.json in the project root. If the project is not set up for the shadcn CLI yet, follow the get started page for your case: new projects run "npx shadcn@latest init @coss/style", existing projects run "npx shadcn@latest add @coss/ui".
3. Make sure the design tokens exist in your global stylesheet (app/globals.css). The theme uses the shadcn variables plus extra tokens the docs list: --info, --info-foreground, --success, --success-foreground, --warning, --warning-foreground, --destructive-foreground. The CLI adds them for you when you use @coss/style.
4. Add your first component with the command shown on its docs page, for example "npx shadcn@latest add @coss/button" from https://coss.com/ui/docs/components/button. The alternative is manual copy-paste from the Code tab of that page.
5. First usage: import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button", render <Button>Button</Button> in an existing page, and confirm the build still passes. Repeat step 4 for the other components you need, and check each component page for extra dependencies.

If you specifically need the legacy Origin UI components (copy-and-paste, Radix based), browse https://coss.com/origin and copy the code from the component pages; that surface gets limited maintenance.`,

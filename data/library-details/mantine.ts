  agentPrompt: `Add Mantine to this existing React project.

Prerequisites: a React 18+ app (Vite, Next.js, or React Router recommended; Create React App is not supported), with PostCSS available through your bundler. Check the framework guide at https://mantine.dev/guides/vite/ or https://mantine.dev/guides/next/ if your setup differs.

Steps:
1. Install the runtime packages: "npm install @mantine/core @mantine/hooks". Install PostCSS tooling: "npm install --save-dev postcss postcss-preset-mantine postcss-simple-vars".
2. Create postcss.config.cjs in the project root with plugins "postcss-preset-mantine" and "postcss-simple-vars" (set the mantine-breakpoint-xs through mantine-breakpoint-xl variables as shown in the docs).
3. In the app root, import "@mantine/core/styles.css" first, then wrap your tree in <MantineProvider> with a theme created by createTheme. For SSR frameworks add <ColorSchemeScript /> to the document head and spread mantineHtmlProps on the <html> element.
4. Render one component to confirm it works, for example import { Button } from "@mantine/core" and place it in an existing page.
5. Add extra packages only when needed (for example @mantine/form, @mantine/dates, @mantine/notifications), importing each one's styles.css after the core styles.

Consult the official docs at https://mantine.dev/getting-started/ before deviating from these steps, since PostCSS setup and provider props change between major versions.`,

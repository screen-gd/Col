  agentPrompt: `Use AI Canvas (https://aicanvas.me), an open-core registry of animated React components, blocks, design systems and templates built with Tailwind CSS and Motion, inside my existing project.

Prerequisites:
- My stack is React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS. Check the project root has a components.json; if not, run npx shadcn@latest init first.
- Components are copied source files, not an npm package. Do not npm install aicanvas.
- Installs need an AICANVAS_TOKEN (free account). Without it the shadcn CLI still exits 0 but writes a placeholder file titled "(free account required)" instead of the real component, so verify the installed file's title before claiming success.
- The registry is in the official shadcn directory, so the CLI resolves @aicanvas/<slug> with no extra setup. The token lives in .env.local as AICANVAS_TOKEN and is wired in components.json under registries: { "@aicanvas": { "url": "https://aicanvas.me/r/{name}.json", "params": { "token": "\${AICANVAS_TOKEN}" } } }.

Steps:
1. Read the current catalog at https://aicanvas.me/llms.txt instead of guessing slugs; the machine-readable index is https://aicanvas.me/r/registry.json. Do not read the whole index into context, grep it for what I need.
2. Pick a component that fits what I described, then install it from the project root with: npx shadcn@latest add @aicanvas/<slug>. Real slugs include magnetic-dots, sticker-wall, glass-navbar, polaroid-stack, task-cards and ripple-type.
3. First usage: import the installed component into an existing page, adapt it to my theme tokens and import conventions, and confirm the app still builds. Ask me whether I want its AICANVAS remix prompt applied.
4. Prefer the AI Canvas MCP server when I want you to browse and install without copy-paste. It is already configured if \`claude mcp add aicanvas --scope user -- npx -y @aicanvas/mcp\` has been run (setup guide: https://aicanvas.me/mcp). It is read-only and exposes search_components, get_component, get_component_props, get_install_command, compose_page, validate_usage and get_audit_checklist.
5. Before calling the work done, run validate_usage on the file I touched, then get_audit_checklist for the finishing pass. Note that compose_page plans only and generates no code.

Some components need extra npm packages, for example Three.js for particle-sphere or curious-ai, and Motion for animation. Install whatever the registry item lists as dependencies. Free components are MIT; premium components, design systems and templates need a paid token.

The installed code lives in my repo and is mine to edit.`,

  agentPrompt: `Help me use 21st (https://21st.dev), a community registry of React components published in the shadcn registry format, inside my existing project.

Prerequisites:
- My stack is React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS. Check that the project root has a components.json; if it does not, run npx shadcn@latest init first.
- Components are copied source files, not an npm package. Do not npm install 21st.

Steps:
1. Read the official docs at https://21st.dev. Plain-text versions of pages are available by appending .md (for example https://21st.dev/mcp.md), and https://21st.dev/llms.txt summarizes the product. Use them for current commands instead of guessing.
2. Ask me for a 21st API key. If I do not have one, tell me to create a free key at https://21st.dev/mcp, then export it as API_KEY_21ST.
3. Pick a component from https://21st.dev/community/components (real author and slug from a component page) and install it from the project root with: npx shadcn@latest add "https://21st.dev/r/<author>/<slug>?api_key=$API_KEY_21ST".
4. First usage: after install, import the new component into an existing page or view, adapt it to my theme tokens and import conventions, and confirm the app still builds.
5. Optional: if I want the catalog searchable from my editor, run npx @21st-dev/cli@latest init --client <my agent name> and set my API key where it asks for it.

Keep the installed code in my repo and treat it as mine to edit.`,

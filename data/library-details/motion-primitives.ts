  agentPrompt: `Help me add Motion Primitives (https://motion-primitives.com) animated components to this existing React project.

Motion Primitives is a copy-paste UI kit of animated React components built on Motion and Tailwind CSS. It is not an npm component library: you install individual components and the source lands in my repo as editable files.

Prerequisites:
- My project is React + TypeScript with Tailwind CSS already set up. Check this before starting; the components ship Tailwind class names and render unstyled without it.
- The components need the \`motion\` package (they import from \`motion/react\`, not \`framer-motion\`) and \`lucide-react\` for icons. Install them only if they are missing from package.json.
- They import a \`cn\` helper from \`@/lib/utils\`. If that file does not exist, create it with the exact body from https://motion-primitives.com/docs/installation: \`import { clsx, type ClassValue } from 'clsx'; import { twMerge } from 'tailwind-merge'; export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) { return twMerge(clsx(inputs)); }\` and make sure the \`@/\` alias resolves to my project root.

Steps:
1. Read https://motion-primitives.com/docs/installation for the current setup steps, and pick the component page I need, for example https://motion-primitives.com/docs/accordion.
2. Install the component with the official CLI from the project root: npx motion-primitives@latest add accordion. This writes the component into components/motion-primitives/ and installs its dependencies. To use the shadcn CLI instead, run npx shadcn@latest init first if there is no components.json, then npx shadcn@latest add "https://motion-primitives.com/c/accordion.json". Use a real component name from the docs, not a guess.
3. Confirm the available component names with npx motion-primitives list. The shadcn registry index is at https://motion-primitives.com/c/registry.json.
4. First usage: import the component from the path it was written to, render it in an existing page or view, and adapt its Tailwind classes to my design tokens. Every component file already carries a "use client" directive, so it can be imported from server components in the Next.js App Router. No MotionConfig or other global provider is required, because any configuration is per component.
5. Verify the app still builds and that the animation runs, then check the component page for its props (for example the text-effect per and variants options) before adding more components.

Keep the installed component source in my repo and treat it as mine to edit. Consult the component's docs page for real prop names and defaults rather than inventing them, since the README notes the project is in beta with frequent component and code updates.`,

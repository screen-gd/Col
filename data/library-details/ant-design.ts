  agentPrompt: `Set up Ant Design (antd) in this existing React project.

Prerequisites: a React app on React 18 or newer (antd 6 requires react and react-dom >= 18), Node.js 16 or above, and TypeScript if the project already uses it. This is a component library import, not a CLI-driven generator, so no init command is needed.

Steps:
1. Install the package from the project root: "npm install antd --save" (yarn add antd or pnpm add antd also work).
2. Import a first component to confirm setup, for example in App: import { Button } from 'antd' and render <Button type="primary">Button</Button>.
3. Wrap the application root in ConfigProvider from antd so global settings apply everywhere, for example <ConfigProvider theme={{ token: { colorPrimary: '#1677ff' } }}><App /></ConfigProvider>. Use the same provider with a locale import such as "antd/locale/fr_FR" for internationalization.
4. Add more components as needed by importing them from "antd" (Form, Table, DatePicker, message). Tree shaking keeps unused code out of the bundle.
5. For date pickers with a non-default locale, also import the matching dayjs locale file, since antd uses dayjs for date handling.

Consult the official docs before deviating: getting started at https://ant.design/docs/react/getting-started, Vite setup at https://ant.design/docs/react/use-with-vite, theming at https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme, and the v5 to v6 migration notes at https://ant.design/docs/react/migration-v6.`,

  agentPrompt:
    "Add GSAP, the JavaScript animation library, to my existing web project (vanilla JS/TS or any framework such as React or Vue, built with a bundler like Vite, Next.js or webpack). Prerequisites: Node.js and npm already set up in the repo.\n\nSteps:\n1. Install the official package with `npm install gsap`. No extra config is required; the package ships ESM and TypeScript types. For React, also run `npm install @gsap/react`.\n2. In the file that owns the UI, import the core: `import { gsap } from \"gsap\";`.\n3. Add one first animation against an element that already exists in the markup: `gsap.to(\".hero-title\", { x: 360, duration: 1, ease: \"power2.out\" });`.\n4. If the animation should react to scrolling, import `{ ScrollTrigger } from \"gsap/ScrollTrigger\"`, call `gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger)` once at module scope, and add `scrollTrigger: { trigger: \".section\", start: \"top center\" }` to the tween. Register plugins explicitly so tree shaking does not remove them.\n5. In React components, wrap animation code in `useGSAP(() => { ... }, { scope: container })` from `@gsap/react` for automatic cleanup on unmount.\n\nConsult the official docs at https://gsap.com/docs/v3/ (installation: https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Installation, React: https://gsap.com/resources/React) for API details. Use only plugin names and import paths documented there, for example `gsap/ScrollTrigger`.",

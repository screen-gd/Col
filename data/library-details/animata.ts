  agentPrompt: `Add Animata (https://animata.design) to this existing project: a free, MIT licensed collection of hand-crafted animation, effect and interaction components for React and Tailwind CSS. There is no animata npm package to import. The component source is copied into my repo the same way shadcn/ui works.

Prerequisites:
- My stack is React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS. The Animata repo itself runs Next.js, React and Tailwind CSS v4, but the components only need React and Tailwind.
- Animata components import through the "@/" alias, so the project needs a components folder at the root and a matching paths entry in tsconfig.json.
- Some components import the motion package (https://motion.dev) and lucide-react. Install those only when the copied source needs them.

Steps:
1. Read the setup guide at https://animata.design/docs/setup, then install the base dependencies: npm install tailwind-merge clsx lucide-react. Do not add the tailwindcss-animate plugin; Tailwind CSS v4 includes the animation utilities.
2. Create utils.ts with the cn helper from the same guide, built on clsx and tailwind-merge, and make sure it sits where the "@/..." imports in the component code resolve.
3. Pick a component from the catalog, for example https://animata.design/docs/button/toggle-switch, and install it from the project root with pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://animata.design/r/button/toggle-switch.json. The registry writes components/animata/button/toggle-switch.tsx into my repo. If shadcn is not configured, copy the source from the component page into that file instead.
4. First usage: import the component into an existing page or view, adapt it to my theme tokens and import conventions, and confirm the app still builds.
5. If an animation does not run, check whether the docs page omits CSS: copy the missing @keyframes or @theme values from the component source in https://github.com/codse/animata.

Treat every installed file as mine to edit, and take component APIs, dependencies and CSS only from animata.design.`,

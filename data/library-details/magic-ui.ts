  agentPrompt: `Add Magic UI (https://magicui.design) to this existing project.

Prerequisites: React + TypeScript with Tailwind CSS already configured (Next.js works out of the box). Magic UI components are distributed through the shadcn registry: the CLI copies the source files into the project as editable files, so you do not import them from an npm package.

Steps:
1. Read the official docs at https://magicui.design/docs (installation page: https://magicui.design/docs/installation) and use those commands rather than guessing.
2. Check for a components.json in the project root. If it is missing, run "npx shadcn@latest init" and answer the prompts so shadcn is set up for this stack.
3. Pick a component from https://magicui.design/components and install it from the project root with "npx shadcn@latest add @magicui/<name>" (for example "npx shadcn@latest add @magicui/globe").
4. First usage: import the component from its path shown on its docs page (for the globe it is "@/components/ui/globe"), render it in an existing page, and confirm the app still builds.
5. Repeat step 3 for any other component you need. npm dependencies listed by each component are installed by the CLI automatically; install peers yourself only if the docs page for that component says so.

Keep the copied component files in the repo and edit them freely to match this project's theme.`,

  agentPrompt: `Add Chakra UI v3 to this existing React project.

Prerequisites: Node.js 20.x or newer, React 18 or newer, and a bundler-based app (Next.js, Vite, Remix, and others are supported). Chakra UI runs on Emotion, so @emotion/react must be installed.

Steps:
1. Read package.json and the project config to detect the package manager (npm, pnpm, yarn, bun) and the framework.
2. Install the core packages: npm i @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react (use the matching command for the detected package manager).
3. Generate the snippet components with npx @chakra-ui/cli snippet add. This creates files under components/ui, including the provider. If the generated files import next-themes and it is not installed, install it too.
4. Wrap the application root with Provider imported from "@/components/ui/provider". In Next.js App Router, add suppressHydrationWarning to the <html> element as the docs show.
5. In tsconfig set compilerOptions to module "ESNext", moduleResolution "Bundler", skipLibCheck true, and paths "@/*" pointing at the source directory so the snippet imports resolve.
6. Smoke test by rendering a visible Button: import { Button, HStack } from "@chakra-ui/react".

Consult the official docs at https://chakra-ui.com/docs/get-started/installation and its framework guide for your stack before deviating, since setup differs per framework. When done, list the files you changed and how to start the dev server.`,

  agentPrompt: `Add Flowbite to this existing project. Flowbite is an open source component library built with Tailwind CSS utility classes, MIT licensed, documented at https://flowbite.com/docs/.

Prerequisites: Node.js and npm, and a project that already builds Tailwind CSS v4. If Tailwind is not installed yet, install tailwindcss, @tailwindcss/postcss and postcss first and register the PostCSS plugin.

Steps:
1. Install the package: npm install flowbite (latest published version is 4.x).
2. In the CSS entry file that imports Tailwind, add: @import "flowbite/src/themes/default"; @plugin "flowbite/plugin"; @source "../node_modules/flowbite"; (adjust the @source path if node_modules sits elsewhere). Keep the Tailwind import above them.
3. Make the interactive components work by importing the bundle in your app entry file: import 'flowbite'. Alternatively include dist/flowbite.min.js with a script tag before </body>.
4. First usage: copy the Modal example from https://flowbite.com/docs/components/modal/ into a page, using its data attributes (data-modal-target, data-modal-toggle) so it opens and closes, then confirm Tailwind utilities from Flowbite classes are emitted in the built CSS.
5. If this is a React project, prefer running npx flowbite-react@latest init instead of the manual setup, and use components from the flowbite-react package.

Consult https://flowbite.com/docs/ for the framework specific guides (Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Angular, Astro, Laravel and others), the Tailwind v3 to v4 upgrade guide if the project still runs Tailwind v3, and the configuration page for theming and dark mode.`,

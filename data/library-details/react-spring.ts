  agentPrompt: `Help me use React Spring (https://react-spring.dev) in this existing project, which already has React and a build tool such as Vite or Next.js.

Prerequisites:
- React with hooks. The current major version is v10, whose peer range is ^16.8.0 || ^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0, so React 19 works.
- Do not install the packages under the old "react-spring" scope names other than @react-spring/web; there is no @react-spring/gestures package on npm.

Steps:
1. Install the web entry point: npm install @react-spring/web. Everything commonly used is exported from that single package; @react-spring/web re-exports @react-spring/core and adds \`animated\`.
2. In the component that owns the UI, import what you need from "@react-spring/web". The current API is hooks plus a component factory: useSpring, useSprings, useTrail, useTransition, useSpringValue, useSpringRef, useInView, useScroll, useResize, useReducedMotion, useChain, to, interpolate, config, and \`animated\`. There is no \`useGesture\` in v10 — gestures are handled with your own pointer/touch handlers or a gesture library.
3. Make one first working animation before touching anything else:
   const style = useSpring({ from: { opacity: 0, transform: "translate3d(0,-20px,0)" }, to: { opacity: 1, transform: "translate3d(0,0px,0)" } });
   return <animated.div style={style} />;
   Only useSpring is required; the other hooks are optional.
4. Choose the hook that matches the job: \`useSpring\` for one element, \`useSprings(length, ...)\` for a list, \`useTrail\` for staggered lists, and \`useTransition\` for enter/exit when items mount and unmount. Take the second element of the return value ([style, api]) when you need api.start, api.stop, or api.pause.
5. Set the physics with the \`config\` presets — config.gentle, config.wobbly, config.stiff, config.slow, config.molasses — or with tension, friction and mass. Wire \`useReducedMotion()\` into your springs so the animation respects the user's reduced-motion setting.
6. If I am animating inside react-three-fiber, install a separate package: npm install @react-spring/three (v10 targets @react-three/fiber >=6.0 and three >=0.126). Import \`animated\` and \`useSpring\` from "@react-spring/three" in that scene, not from "@react-spring/web".

Keep the existing styling, TypeScript setup and build tooling unchanged. Read the docs at https://react-spring.dev before writing code; the reference for the common hooks is at https://react-spring.dev/docs/common-hooks/use-spring.`,

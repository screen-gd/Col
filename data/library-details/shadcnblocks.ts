  agentPrompt: `Help me use Shadcnblocks (https://www.shadcnblocks.com) in this existing project: a paid commercial
library of extra shadcn/ui blocks, components, pages and templates that installs through the shadcn CLI registry.
There is no shadcnblocks npm package, so do not add one to package.json.

Prerequisites:
- React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4. Shadcnblocks blocks target Tailwind v4, not v3.
- A shadcn/ui project with a components.json at the root. If it is missing, run npx shadcn@latest init; on an older
  project run shadcn apply or shadcn create first.
- For Pro or Premium blocks, a Shadcnblocks plan and an API key from Dashboard > API Keys.

Steps:
1. Read the official docs at https://www.shadcnblocks.com/docs/blocks/getting-started, the CLI reference at
   https://www.shadcnblocks.com/docs/shadcn-cli/overview and the theming notes at
   https://www.shadcnblocks.com/docs/blocks/theming, and take commands from there instead of guessing them.
2. Register the source. Add "@shadcnblocks": "https://www.shadcnblocks.com/r/{style}/{name}" to the registries
   object in components.json. The {style} token resolves to the Base UI or React Aria build when the project style
   is base-* or aria-*; see https://www.shadcnblocks.com/docs/primitive-libraries/overview if a block touches
   primitive APIs.
3. Add the theme: npx shadcn@latest add @shadcnblocks/theme/shadcnblocks. It writes the extra CSS variables the
   blocks read (shadow, radius, chart and sidebar tokens) into globals.css.
4. Pick the block I asked for at https://www.shadcnblocks.com/blocks, take the real @shadcnblocks/<name> id from
   its page, and install it from the project root with: npx shadcn add @shadcnblocks/<name>.
5. First usage: import the installed block into an existing page, replace its placeholder copy, links and images,
   map its props onto the project's conventions, and confirm the build still passes.
6. If an install fails, check https://www.shadcnblocks.com/docs/shadcn-cli/troubleshooting. The usual causes are a
   missing SHADCNBLOCKS_API_KEY, a registry entry still using a plain URL, and a monorepo path problem.

Only the paid tiers are gated. Every block lands in my repo as editable source that I own, so adapt it to my theme
tokens and import paths rather than leaving it as shipped. Prefer the CLI over the site Code tab: copy and paste
skips the npm packages and the shadcn components a block builds on.`,

Prerequisites: a React project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS already installed, plus an "@/*" path alias in tsconfig.json pointing at the project root (use "./src/*" if the app lives in src/). If Tailwind CSS is missing, install it first, and make sure the alias exists before running the CLI.

Steps:
1. From the project root run "npx shadcn@latest init" and follow the prompts (style, base color, options). This writes components.json, installs the required dependencies, adds the cn utility and configures CSS variables in your global CSS file. If the project is a monorepo, run it in the workspace that owns the global CSS, or pass "-c <path>".
2. Add a first component: "npx shadcn@latest add button".
3. Use it once to confirm the setup: import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button" and render it in an existing page.
4. Treat the generated files under components/ui as your own source code and edit them freely.

Consult the official docs before deviating from these steps: installation at https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation and CLI reference at https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli, since flags and prompts change between releases.`,

  agentPrompt: `Add Ruixen UI (https://ruixen.com) to this existing project: 200+ marketing sections and
components for shadcn projects, installed as source files through the shadcn CLI.

Prerequisites: React with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. Ruixen's install page follows the same process as
shadcn/ui, so the project has to be set up for the shadcn CLI first.

Steps:
1. Read the official docs instead of guessing: https://ruixen.com/docs, the install guide at
https://ruixen.com/docs/installation, and the catalog at https://ruixen.com/docs/components.
2. Check for a components.json in the project root. If the project is not set up for the shadcn CLI, run
npx shadcn@latest init first, which is step 1 of the official install page.
3. Match the registry variant to this project. Every component is published four times: /r/[name] for
Tailwind v4 + Radix UI, /r/tw3/[name] for Tailwind v3 + Radix UI, /r/baseui/[name] for Tailwind v4 +
Base UI, and /r/baseui/tw3/[name] for Tailwind v3 + Base UI.
4. Choose a component from the catalog, copy the install command from its page, and run it from the
project root, for example: npx shadcn@latest add "https://ruixen.com/r/invert-tabs". The CLI writes the
component to components/ruixen/ and installs the dependencies that registry item declares.
5. Import it from the copied path, for example import { InvertTabs } from "@/components/ruixen/invert-tabs",
render it in an existing page, and confirm the build still passes.
6. Optional: for AI editor integration, add the official MCP server from https://ruixen.com/docs/mcp. It is
a stdio server that reads the live registry and exposes listRegistryItems, searchRegistryItems and
getRegistryItem, so component sources and props come from the registry rather than guesswork.

Components animate with spring physics from motion/react, and many play a short Web Audio API tick on
interaction; pass sound={false} to silence it. The installed files are plain source in this repo, so treat
them as yours to edit.`,

  agentPrompt: `Add Aceternity UI (https://ui.aceternity.com) to this existing project.

Prerequisites: React or Next.js (Next.js 14+ recommended), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v3 or v4 already configured. Components are distributed as source code through the shadcn registry, so there is no npm package to install; the code is copied into the project.

Steps:
1. Run "npx shadcn@latest init" if the project has no components.json yet.
2. Add this to components.json: { "registries": { "@aceternity": "https://ui.aceternity.com/registry/{name}.json" } }
3. Install one component to verify the flow: "npx shadcn@latest add @aceternity/bento-grid" (the full URL form "npx shadcn@latest add https://ui.aceternity.com/registry/bento-grid.json" also works).
4. Install peers: "npm install motion" for animated components. 3D components also need "three" and "@react-three/fiber".
5. Import the component from the components directory and render it in an existing page, adjusting classes to match this project's theme.

Check the official docs at https://ui.aceternity.com (CLI reference: https://ui.aceternity.com/components/cli) for per component options and extra dependencies before adding more components.`,

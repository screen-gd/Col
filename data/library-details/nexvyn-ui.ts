  agentPrompt: `Add Nexvyn UI (https://ui.nexvyn.dev) to this existing project. It is an animated React component library distributed through the shadcn/ui registry protocol, not an npm package: components are copied source files into your repo.

Prerequisites:
- The project is React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4 with shadcn/ui already installed. Check for \`components.json\` at the project root; if it is missing, run \`npx shadcn@latest init\` first.
- The library itself is never \`npm install\`ed. The npm search for "nexvyn" returns no packages, so do not try to add one.
- Components expect the shadcn \`cn\` helper at \`@/lib/utils\` and the standard shadcn CSS variables. Both already exist in a shadcn project.

Steps:
1. Add the registry: \`npx shadcn@latest registry add @nexvyn\`. This is optional if you prefer the direct-URL form, but it lets you install by short name.
2. Pick a component from https://ui.nexvyn.dev/components. The full machine-readable catalog is the registry index at https://ui.nexvyn.dev/r/registry.json, and each item is served at https://ui.nexvyn.dev/r/<name>.json. Read those before choosing so you use a real name.
3. Install it from the project root with \`npx shadcn@latest add @nexvyn/<name>\`, or without the registry with \`npx shadcn@latest add https://ui.nexvyn.dev/r/<name>.json\`. The registry uses \`bunx\` in its README; \`npx\` is the equivalent and is what the site itself shows.
4. Review what landed. Each item may write more than the component: shared helpers such as \`lib/sound.ts\` (optional hover/click/bounce sound cues, muted state stored in localStorage) and \`lib/motion-tokens.ts\` can be pulled in alongside. Dependencies declared by the item are installed for you; \`motion\` is the common one, and some items also need \`@radix-ui/react-slot\`, \`class-variance-authority\`, \`@base-ui/react\` or \`pdfjs-dist\`.
5. First usage: import the component into an existing page or view, check that it renders with your current theme, and confirm the app still builds. The library targets Next.js 16 + React 19, but the components are plain client components, so they work in Vite and other React setups too.
6. Respect accessibility: components use \`useReducedMotion\` from motion for animation fallbacks and ship keyboard patterns (roving tabindex, arrow-key navigation, focus traps). Do not remove those. If the UI sound cues are unwanted, keep \`lib/sound.ts\` but do not wire the \`play*\` helpers into your call sites.

Use only the registry JSON and the component pages on https://ui.nexvyn.dev as the source of truth, and re-read the item JSON whenever a component needs behavior that is not visible in the demo. The installed code is yours to edit.`,
